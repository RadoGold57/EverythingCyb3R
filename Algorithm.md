# So here is a quick guide on how to setup the repo:

1. First pick or go to either Red, Blue or Purple Team section, Select a Job Role and start upadting the skills, certifications, books & podcasts and labs, by searching randomly and also giving out any private or very hard to find content based on that job role.
 The format will be in json,
        {
          "name": "Example Name",
          "author": "Example Author",
          "url": "http://example.com"
        }

2. Submit pull request!

3. Use Xmind to create a mindmapper of how the job role and it's workings should go about check Adversial Threat Emulation on how it was created, and use that sample or this to form your mind map ps: it should be accurate and intact not to misguide beginners
