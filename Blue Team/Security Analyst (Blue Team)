### INTRODUCTION TO SOC ###

What is SoC?
A security operation center is A combination of people, processes, and technology protecting the information systems of an organization through:

Proactive design and configuration.
Ongoing monitoring of system state.
Detection of unintended actions or undesirable states.
Minimizing damage from unwanted effects.

Objectives of SoC:
Log Collection
Log Aggregation
Security Analytics and Correlation.
Building Threat Intelligence and Early Warning Detection System Incident Response Handling.
Monitors the Cyber Security posture and reports deficiencies.
Performs Threat and Vulnerability Analysis.
Provide Alerts and Notifications to General and Specific Threats.
Coordinates with regulatory bodies.
SoC Environment:
People:
The SoC crew should consist of people who are familiar with security alerts and threats and how to handle them, and also as security threats are constantly changing and evolving the SoC crew should be people who are willing to update their knowledge constantly.

Technology:
A good SoC team should have an excellent toolkit of security audits and penetration testing tools and technologies such as Protocols, SIEM, SOAR, IMS, and Detection Countermeasures, updating your tools and following up with the recent security trends is needed with also the existence of a powerful documentation system to log incidents.

Processes:
A professional SoC crew should have a standardized process of incident handling moving from tier 1 to 3 that ensures the effectiveness of the handling process.

 

An example of an incident handling process steps are:

Triage
Escalation and handling
Investigation
Analysis
SoC Core Roles and Duties:
1- Analyst
SoC analysts are the first responders for any kind of cyberattack, their mission is to monitor, report, and implement powerful evasion techniques, they also do vulnerability analysis and product testing to identify any possible weaknesses and make suggestions based on their findings, they also have a major role in doing recovery plans and so on.

2- SoC Admin
3- SoC Lead
The role of this position is to lead the rest of the team in their activities like monitoring, identification, and reporting.

3- SoC Manager
The SoC manager role is more comprehensive than the SoC lead as SoC managers manage the teams' operations and provide technical guidance besides training and evaluation, SoC managers are also responsible for reporting incidents to the chief information security officer.

4- Cyber Threat Intelligence
Cyber threat intelligence is the skill of collecting information out of cyberspace that has been previously analyzed and shared between organizations about different attack scenarios and vectors.
